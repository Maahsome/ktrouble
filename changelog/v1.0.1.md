## v1.0.1

### Changes

#### [Pull Request #48](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/48)

- Added output to the 'ktrouble pull -a'  command to show utilities that have been "updated"


### Bug Fixes

#### [Pull Request #48](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/48)

- When pulling existing utility definitions from upstream, I missed setting the newly created `environments` property, so the utility would remain "different" in the `ktrouble status` command.
