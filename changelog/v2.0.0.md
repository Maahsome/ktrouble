## v2.0.0

### Additions

#### [Pull Request #53](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/53)

- Added a Tags property to the UtilityDefinitions, to allow multiple Tags to be assigned to an image.
  - The prompt for selecting a utility now includes `environmentname/image name:tag` combinations
  - The `launch` command now has an `--environment` and `--tag` that can be used with `--name` for launching a utility.
- Added a `combine` command.  This will help with migrating utilities that have been added multiple times to handle multiple tags in previous versions
- 


### Changes

#### [Pull Request #53](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/53)

- Remove tracking of `source` for a utility.  All utilities are effectively `local` sources
