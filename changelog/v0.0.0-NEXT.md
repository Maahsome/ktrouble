## v0.0.0-NEXT

### Additions

#### [Pull Request #47](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/47)

- `ktrouble` now supports `environments`, to allow a utility to be launched into different clusters that may need to pull from different image registries.
- New commands:
  - `ktrouble add environment`
  - `ktrouble get environment`
  - `ktrouble update environment`
  - `ktrouble remove environment`
  - `ktrouble migrate`
- Added versioning to the local config file, and also the upstream git repository
  - The git repository will now contain `vN` where N is the `semver.MAJOR` of the application
  - A migration process will copy the utility definitions from a previous directory to latest

#### [Pull Request #46](https://github.com/Maahsome/ktrouble/pull/46)

- Add the `attach` command, allowing one to add an ephemeral container to an existing POD
- Add the `get attachments` command, allowing one to list the currently active attached ephemeral containers
